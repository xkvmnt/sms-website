**Evaluation Setup**

As part of the course, we were asked to conduct a small user study to gather feedback on our implementation. This study required at least two participants to test our project using virtual reality headsets, traverse the parkour course, and complete the interaction tasks. Besides myself I had two individuals participating in my study **(n = 3)**. 

Before starting the main task, participants were given a few minutes to get comfortable with the VR environment and the controls. During this "warum-up" I explained to them the interaction tasks they were about to solve so they had a general idea of what they have to do. Once comfortable, they were tasked with traversing the course, completing the interaction challenges, and collecting as many coins as possible. Afterward, I analyzed various metrics collected during gameplay, processing them into a structured format to draw meaningful conclusions. 

Since there were no strict constraints on what aspects we could evaluate in our study, I also chose to use a simplified version of the Game Experience Questionnaire (GEQ). The GEQ is a standardized tool used in game research to assess different aspects of a player's experiences and emotions during and after playing a game as well as insights into the social presence if the game has been played with multiple people. After playing the game the participants are asked to rate if they felt a certain way during or after the experience using a scale ranging from **"Not at all" (0)** to **"Extremely" (4)**. My simplified version tuned this scale down to **"disagree" (0)**, **"neutral" (1)** and **"agree" (2)** because of the low sample size of only three participants. The Questionnaire itself focused on the following aspects: fun and enjoyment, wether the user experienced cybersickness and the intuitiveness of the implementation.

Results from GEQ:

Question 1: "I have experienced cybersickness during gameplay"

Question 2: "I had fun traversing through the course and solving the interaction tasks"

Question 3: "I experienced the controls as intuitive and easy to use"

**Conclusion**

Looking at the results from the GEQ, it can generally be concluded that a fun and engaging locomotion and interaction technique were successfully implemented while keeping cybersickness to a minimum. However, not all participants found the controls to be equally intuitive. This observation is further supported by the gameplay metrics - my mom (Participant 3) struggled quite a bit :D. Generally, those more familiar with technology had an easier time understanding and adapting to the controls. Additionally, my own performance was noticeably better as well, likely due to my familiarity with the locomotion and interaction techniques from having developed them myself.

Overall, Iâ€™m grateful for the opportunity to participate in this course and expand my knowledge of Unity development, particularly in the field of VR implementation. Beyond development, I also had a great time exploring the VR headset outside of the project by playing VR games and experimenting with its various functionalities, as this was my first hands-on experience with a virtual reality headset.
