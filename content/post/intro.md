Having some experience with Unity development, particularly in creating a creative space in a multiplayer scenario as a sort of game as part of my bachelorâ€™s thesis, I have always wanted to expand my skills and explore new topics in greater depth. In the winter semester of 2024/2025, I had the opportunity to participate in the lecture *Interaction in Virtual and Augmented Reality*.

The goal of this lecture was to implement a locomotion technique that allows movement within a 3D environment, as well as an interaction technique enabling users to interact with objects in the virtual world. To apply our knowledge, we were provided with a template Unity project featuring a parkour course that users needed to traverse while interacting with various objects. In addition to that we were given Meta Quest Headsets to be able to develop, test and run our projects on this device.
